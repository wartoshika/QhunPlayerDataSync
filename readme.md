QhunPlayerDataSync
==================

**Important**: This plugin is currently under heavy development. Please wait for the release or the snapshot might be buggy. Use at your own risk. I can not recommend to run this plugin on a live server enviroment!


This is a plugin for bukkit/spigot server that allows to share player related data between different server. It is designed to work with bungee cord and provides a lot of freedom when it comes to configuration.

History
-------

I decided to run my own minecraft server. After I was looking for plugins that allow the sync of data between my servers in the network, I found out that there aren't any good or free plugins available.

Because I have been developing for many years in multiple languages I decided to write the plugins for myself. The main focus is to allow many server owners to use this plugin for free and with their help we can make this plugin even better.


Contributions

Any contribution is appreciated. Please fork this project and send me a pullrequest.
As soon as I manage to bring up the unit tests, every pullrequest has to pass these tests and every feature added should bring new tests with it.

Please add the console output to figure out what is going wrong.


Plans
-----

With the start of my minecraft server I will start question the community for additional features and this plugin might be the right place.

Currently todo:
    - Enable table prefixing

Currently broken:
    - Live sync of economy
